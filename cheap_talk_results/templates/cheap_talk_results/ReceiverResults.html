            <h2>Please read the following information carefully!
            </h2>

            <p>
                Throughout the experiment, your identity will be completely anonymous and
                will not be disclosed to anyone else. All participants will receive these exact same instructions.<br>
                </p>

            <p> <em>Note: If only the male form is chosen, this is not meant to be gender-specific but serves solely
                 for the better comprehensibility and legibility of the text.

            <p>
                <h2>About the experiment
                </h2>
            <p> The experiment will take about 25 minutes. For participating in the experiment you will earn $1
             for sure and can earn up to $6 in bonus payments, depending on your and other participants’ behavior.<br><br>

            There will be a total of 20 rounds, followed by a short survey that will not affect your payment in
             any way. At the end of the experiment, only one of the 20 rounds will be randomly selected, and the earnings
             in that round will determine your bonus payment.
            </p><p>
        <h2>Course of the experiment
        </h2>

        <p>
        Each participant will be randomly assigned a role – either the role of the sender or the role of the receiver.
        Roles will not change at any time. In each round, two senders and one receiver will be playing together.
        You will be randomly grouped with two other participants each round, so you won't always face the same
        sender(s) or reciever. The probability of being grouped with the same participants is very low.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2>Each round will take place as follows:
        </h2>
        <ol>
                <li><p>At the beginning of the round, each sender will get 10 lottery tickets. These lottery tickets have no
                    value to the sender, but to the receiver. Each ticket can either be a winning ticket or a blank. The number
                    of winning tickets out of the 10 is randomly assigned to each sender each round. There can be 1, 3, 5, 7
                    or 9 winning tickets out of the 10. The rest are always blanks. Only the sender will know how many of his
                    10 tickets are winning tickets.</p></li>
                <li><p>Each sender sends a message to the receiver, indicating the number of winning lottery tickets he has
                    (again taking values of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9). The message does not have to indicate the true number of winning
                    ticketsa.</p></li>
                <li><p>Based on the messages by the two senders in his group, the receiver has to choose one of the senders. The
                    chosen sender earns a bonus payment of $6. The other sender receives a bonus payment of $0.</p></li>
                <li><p> For the receiver, the bonus payment is determined by a lottery. The lottery box contains the 10 lottery
                     tickets of the sender he has chosen. One out of the 10 lottery tickets is drawn and determines the
                     receivers' bonus payment for this round – either $5 if it's a winning ticket or $0 if a blank is drawn.
                     All tickets are discarded at the end of each round, so they don't carry over to the next round.<br><br>
                    Hint: Remember that the senders' message does not have to indicate the true number of winning tickets. </p></li>
                <li><p>The receiver will be informed about the result of each rounds' lottery after the final round. In some
                    rounds the receiver may also learn how many winning tickets actually were in the box. If so, everyone will
                    be informed about that prior to these rounds. Senders will learn in which rounds they have been chosen when
                    they receive their bonus payment. Everyone will see a short summary of their choices after the last round.
                </p></li>
        </ol>
            <p>
                <h2>Example:
                </h2>

            <p>
                Sender A has received 7 winning tickets (blue), while sender B has received 3. Sender A chooses to send the
                message 7 while Sender B chooses to send message 9. After observing both messages, but not the actual number of
                winning tickets, the receiver can choose either A or B.<br>
                </p>

            <p>
                Let's assume the receiver choses sender B. Sender B will earn $6, while sender A will earn nothing. Out of the
                10 tickets of sender B, one will be randomly drawn. If it is a blue winning ticket, the receiver will earn
                $5. If it is a red blank he will earn nothing.
        <br>
